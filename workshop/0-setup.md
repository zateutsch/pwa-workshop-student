# Set up your environment

First things first, let's get your development environment ready. We will be installing the tools we need to build our Progressive Web App. And we will create a repository to keep track our coding progress.

## Install tools

Make sure you go to the following resources to install the tools you need:
- [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/edge)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/students/)

## Create a repository

1. If you don't have a GitHub account, go ahead and [join GitHub](https://github.com/join). Then, [create a new public repository](https://github.com/new) named **repose**. If you've never made a GitHub repository before, check out the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo) for more information. Make sure to select **Public** and to initialize the repository **without** a **README**.
1. We will push the directory created in the next step to this repository.

## Next steps

Awesome! You have the tools you need to begin creating your Progressive Web App. Now, let's get to work. üëâüèº Head to [1-create-pwa.md](1-create-pwa.md) to get started.
